## üåê Live Site

üöÄ Here is a working live site: [horizon.markaustria.com](https://horizon.markaustria.com/)

## üìù Description

Welcome to Horizon, a comprehensive online banking platform that connects to multiple bank accounts, displays real-time transactions, and enables secure money transfers between users!

Traditional financial trackers often function like simple to-do apps where users manually add income, deduct expenses, and view basic charts. These solutions lack real banking functionality and connectivity to actual financial institutions. I built Horizon to address this gap by creating a more sophisticated platform.

Horizon solves the problem of disconnected financial tracking by connecting to real bank accounts, displaying genuine transaction data, and facilitating actual money transfers between users.

The platform offers secure authentication, real-time bank account connectivity, transaction history with filtering, and a payment transfer system between accounts.

**Technologies Used:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Sentry, Appwrite, Plaid, Dwolla, React Hook Form, Zod, Chart.js
